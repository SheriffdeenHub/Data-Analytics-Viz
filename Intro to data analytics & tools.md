1. What do you understand by data analysis and visualization?

Data analytics is the process of taking data and using it to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights that enable individuals and organizations to make better decisions. Extensively, data visualization is the representation of the result of data analysis in a visual form to aid decision making.

2. List and explain the different data analysis tools you know focusing on their features, strengths, and weaknesses.

Here is a list of some widely used data analysis tools, along with their key features, strengths, and weaknesses:

1. Microsoft Excel

Strengths:
     
     - User-friendly and widely accessible.
     - Suitable for small to moderate datasets.
     - Excellent for quick data manipulation, basic statistical analysis, and visualisation.
   
   Weaknesses:
     
     - Limited handling of large datasets and advanced analytics.
     - Can become cumbersome with large-scale data.
 
 2. R

Strengths:
     
     - Strong for statistical computing and data analysis.
     - Extensive packages for data manipulation, statistical modelling, and visualisation.
     - Open source and community-driven.
 
 Weaknesses:

     - Some libraries may have performance issues for extremely large datasets.
     - Less specialised for statistical analysis compared to R.

 4. SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences)

Strengths:
     
     - Easy to use for beginners with minimal statistical background.
     - Strong for descriptive statistics, regression, and complex survey data analysis.
     - Built-in reporting features for visualisation.
  
  Weaknesses:
     
     - Expensive proprietary software.
