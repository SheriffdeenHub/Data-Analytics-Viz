# Data-Analytics-Viz
This repository includes projects carried out during the data analytics and visualizations training with 3MTT and Cisco Academy. This projects cover the exploration of data analysis and visualization, which are vital components of the data science process. Using various datasets as case study, I derived insights and effectively communicated findings to make the data meaningful and easily understandable.
I used various tools such as Excel, Python, PowerBI, VSCode, and Tableau to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I identified data patterns, visualized data distributions and relationships, summarized datasets using statistical measures. 
Here, I also delved into relational databases. I gained hands-on experience writing basic SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate structured data effectively.
