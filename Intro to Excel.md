Key Differences between Categorical Data and Numerical Data

A. Nature of Data:
Categorical Data: Refers to data that can be grouped into categories or labels. This data is qualitative and represents characteristics like names, types, or labels (e.g., gender, colours, product types)

Numerical Data: Refers to data that is measurable and can be expressed as numbers. This data is quantitative and includes values that can be added, subtracted, averaged, etc. (e.g., height, weight, age).

B. Types:
Categorical Data: Can be nominal (no inherent order) or ordinal (ordered categories).

Numerical Data: Can be discrete (countable values) or continuous (any value within a range).

C. Operations:
Categorical Data: Cannot be meaningfully added, subtracted, or averaged.

Numerical Data: Can undergo mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, averaging, etc.

How to Use the SUM Function in Excel:

The `SUM` function in Excel is used to add up a range of numbers.
 Syntax: `=SUM(number1, [number2], ...)`

Example: If you want to sum the numbers in cells A1 to A5, you would use the formula:  
`=SUM(A1:A5)`

You can also sum non-adjacent ranges, like this:  
`=SUM(A1:A5, C1:C5)`

Purpose of the AVERAGE Function in Excel:

The `AVERAGE` function in Excel calculates the arithmetic mean of a dataset by summing the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.
Syntax: `=AVERAGE(number1, [number2], ...)`
Example: To calculate the average of numbers in cells B1 to B10, you would use:  
 `=AVERAGE(B1:B10)`
This will return the average value of the numbers in that range.
