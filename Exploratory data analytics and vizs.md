1. Compare different types of data visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) and discuss when to use each type.

1. Bar Charts:
Purpose: Bar charts are used to compare discrete categories or groups. Each bar represents a category, and the length or height of the bar corresponds to the value or frequency.
Strengths:
- Excellent for comparing different groups or categories.
- Easy to read and interpret.
Weaknesses:
- Not suitable for showing relationships between variables.
- Best Used When: You want to compare individual values, e.g., sales by product category, population by country, or survey results by age group.

2. Scatter Plots:
Purpose: Scatter plots display the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point on the plot represents an observation, with its position determined by the values of the variables.
Strengths:
- Ideal for showing correlations, trends, and relationships.
- Helps identify outliers.
Weaknesses:
- Not suitable for categorical data.
- Can become cluttered if there are too many data points.
Best Used When: You need to explore relationships or correlations, such as the relationship between temperature and energy consumption, or advertising spend vs. revenue.

3. Heatmaps:
Purpose: Heatmaps use color to represent data values in a matrix format. The intensity of the color corresponds to the magnitude of the data point.
Strengths:
- Very effective for showing patterns in large datasets.
- Can represent a lot of information in a compact visual form.
Weaknesses:
- Colors can be misinterpreted if not chosen carefully.
- Limited in showing exact values.
Best Used When: You want to visualize density, patterns, or frequency, such as customer activity on a website or gene expression levels across different samples.

4. Line Charts:
Purpose: Line charts show trends or changes over time by connecting data points with a continuous line.
Strengths:
- Ideal for displaying data that changes over time.
- Useful for showing trends, growth, or seasonality.
Weaknesses:
- Not suitable for comparing unrelated categories.
- Best Used When: You need to show trends over time, such as stock prices, temperature changes, or monthly sales.
  
5. Pie Charts:
Purpose: Pie charts show parts of a whole as slices of a circle, with each slice representing a percentage of the total.
Strengths:
- Simple and easy to understand.
Weaknesses:
- Difficult to compare sizes of slices accurately.
- Less effective with too many categories.
Best Used When: Showing proportions or percentages, like market share distribution or survey results where the total equals 100%.

6. Histograms:
Purpose: Histograms display the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing data into intervals (bins) and showing the frequency of data points in each bin.
Strengths:
- Great for understanding the distribution, spread, or frequency of data.
- Shows the shape of the data (e.g., normal distribution, skewness).
Weaknesses:
- Doesn’t work well with categorical data.
- Best Used When: Analyzing the distribution of data, such as age distribution in a population or test scores among students.
  
2. Research and present a case study where data visualization led to significant business insights or decision-making.analysis or automation; libraries like Pandas (Python) and dplyr (R) handle structured data effectively.

Case Study:  
Walmart, one of the largest retailers in the world, leveraged data visualization tools to gain crucial business insights during hurricanes. By analyzing vast amounts of sales data and visualizing it, Walmart identified that certain products, like strawberry Pop- Tarts and beer, surged in demand before a hurricane hit. 

Problem: Walmart faced the challenge of preparing for disasters and ensuring adequate stock of products before and after hurricanes to minimize losses and serve customer needs. 
Approach: 
- Walmart’s analysts used data visualization tools like SAS and Tableau to visualize historical sales data.
- They created line charts and heatmaps to observe purchasing trends during past hurricanes.
- Scatter plots were used to correlate weather forecasts with the surge in demand for specific items.
Insights:
- Through data visualization, Walmart noticed a spike in sales for specific products like Pop-Tarts, bottled water, and beer just before hurricanes.
- This allowed Walmart to anticipate future demand spikes by stockpiling essential goods ahead of natural disasters.
Outcome:
- As a result of these insights, Walmart optimized its inventory for hurricane-prone regions, leading to increased customer satisfaction and improved sales during emergencies.
- The visualization-driven decisions enabled the company to reduce wastage by avoiding stockpiling unnecessary goods.
